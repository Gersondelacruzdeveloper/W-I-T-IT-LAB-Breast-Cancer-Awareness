[Here is a link to the final project](https://vanessacleary.github.io/W-I-T-IT-LAB-Breast-Cancer-Awareness)

BASIC DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT

It is designed to be responsive on a wide range of devices, whilst also being easy to navigate through.

WHY DID WE CHOOSE THIS PROJECT

Transgender people are often overlooked and under-represented as a group, especially when it comes to information and resources available relating to breast cancer.

## User Experience (UX)

### Initial Discussion

WHAT WE WANTED FROM THIS PROJECT

### User Stories

- As a generic user, I want to be made aware of Breast Cancer in under-represented Genders

#### Client Goals

* WHAT THE CLIENT WANTS, NOT THE USER

#### First Time Visitor Goals

* WHAT A FIRST TIME VISITOR WANTS, LIKE EASY TO UNDERSTAND, EASY TO NAVIGATE

#### Returning Visitor Goals

* LIKE REPLAYABILITY, WHY THEY WANT TO RETURN TO THE SITE, EXTRA FEATURES

#### Frequent Visitor Goals

* WHY SOMEONE WOULD COME BACK REPEATEDLY, AND WHAT THEY'D WANT, LIKE EASY TO BOOK SOMETHING, OR A SCOREBOARD, ETC.

## Design

### Color Scheme

* WHAT COLORS USED AND WHY

We chose to use the colours that are in the transgender flag as our site is primarily designed for the transgender community.

### Typography

We have used the google fonts <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito">Nunito</a> and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway">Raleway</a>. These fonts are assessible friendly.

Nunito is a well balanced sans-serif typeface, meaning it does not have any extending "serif" strokes at the end of each character. This font
brings a clean, crisp, balanced feel to the website and render with complete precision in all devices which increases legibility for users. As our
brand is to enhance awareness and increase the reach of the information, this font denotes a calm, relaxed, informal, and approachable set of feelings.
Nunito in our project is used as our content font and is utilised on large contextual reading pieces throughout the project.

Raleway an elegant sans-serif typeface, and sports a display face natural property. A display face font is used for headings/titles/slogans etc and being more eccentric than a restrained sans-serif typeface means it is a perfect font for our headings/titles throughout our project. Like Nunito, and as a sans-serif typeface
Raleway does not sport any extending "serifs" per character making this Font a perfect companion to Nunito and to our users reading/viewing our website on all devices.

“Sans-Serif” is used as the default backup font in cases where these fonts have difficulty loading.

### Imagery

* WHAT IMAGES ARE USED AND WHY

### Wireframes

<details>
  <summary>Here are the wireframes for desktop, mobile and tablet for this project</summary>

1. As a first time user, I want to quickly get an overview of what this site is for 

Mobile:

<img style="width:400px; text-align:center" src="./assets/images/mobile-main.png" alt="Wireframe of mobile landing page">

! <img style="width:400px; text-align:center" src="./assets/images/mobile-contact.png " alt="Wireframe of mobile contact page">

Tablet:

2. As a user, I want to be able to easily navigate to different pages on the site and back again

<img style="width:400px; text-align:center" src="./assets/images/tablet.png" alt="Wireframe of tablet navbar page">

<img style="width:400px; text-align:center" src="./assets/images/tablet-contact.png" alt="Wireframe of tablet contact page">

Screen:

<img style="width:400px; text-align:center" src="./assets/images/full-screen-contact.png" alt="Wireframe of full-screen contact page">

</details>



### Features

* WHAT FEATURES ARE ONE THE SITE, LIKE SCOREBOARD, FUNCTIONS, SCROLLING ALERT BAR, ETC.

The site itself utilises a primary Single-Page-Application style build with secondary/tertiary stand-alone pages added, removing unnecessary bloat from the SPA itself. The SPA is constructed and developed on the `index.html` page, which is situated in the root directory, and encompasses the project's primary information and user group engagement sections.

Within the SPA, the structure is comprised of:
* Navbar to allow for easy navigation within the SPA using Smooth scrolling
* Hero section maintaining a primary landing image & potential brand slogan
* Awareness section which holds key informative detail for the user in bite-size fashion
* Support section which allocates helpful topics for the user
* Resources section.....
* Contact section allowing the user to get in touch with brand ambassadors
* Footer which contains social links/secondary pages such as Privacy/Accessibility statements

Tertiary pages include:
* 404 Error Page in case of incorrect/adverse navigation to pages/directories that may not exist within this project.

#### Awareness Section

The Awareness section utilises html/css/js to promote information about Breast Cancer to an under-promoted User Group, Transgender People. Information in this section was referenced from multiple sources and is cited below in the Credits of this README.

HTML/CSS is used to structure the content and appropriate section layout using up-to-date methods such as Semantic use of HTML and CSS Grid. 3D Model viewers are implemented to promote the human body and in it's native primitive form. The library used to implement these 3D models is <a href="https://modelviewer.dev/">Model Viewer by Google</a>. On page load, the `model-viewer` elements load both models simultaneously to reduce render on view motion on the site, and User interaction controls are removed by default to enhance user experience and accessibility.

Some JS is utilised to detect the current device viewport width, and if less than 992px wide, the `field-of-view` attribute value of the `model-viewer` elements is updated to reflect the smaller viewport allowing for more of the 3D models to be viewed by the user, saving on vital real estate on the device.

The 3D models utilised in the `model-viewer` and situated in the assets directory in their own sub-directory called "models", were obtained from <a href="https://free3d.com/">free3d.com</a>, and heavily modified in Blender to add custom lighting styled on the Transgender Community's Flag, and to add increased sub-division modifier and shadow rendering. Links to both models in Credits section in this README.

#### Contact section

Our site has an email sign-up that the user can sign up to and receive a monthly reminder to check their breasts/chest.
